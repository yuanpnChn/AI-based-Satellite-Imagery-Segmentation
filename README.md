# AI-based-Satellite-Imagery-Segmentation
Imagery segmentation based on a new AI model--Segment Anything Model (SAM)

# Goals:
- Load, interact and download satellite images of any range, scale and resolution from the cloud or locally.
- Use SAM segmentation model to complete the image segmentation task and save the segmentation result objects as geo-referenced .tif and .shp files.
- View segmentation results in the cloud in real time
- **Highly recommend** to conduct segmentation using GPU, or the execute efficiency could be very **LOW**!!!
